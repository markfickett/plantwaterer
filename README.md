Automatic Plant Waterer
=======================

This plant waterer runs on an ATTiny85. It detects the moisture in the plant's
soil and detects whether the water reservoir is empty using a voltage divider
(more water means less resistance means higher voltage detected). It waters the
plant using a pump with a DC motor.
